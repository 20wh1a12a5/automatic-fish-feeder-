MINI PROJECT 

Automatic fish feeder using companion app

Automatic fish feeder is an interesting project. Apart from the existing automated fish feeders, this has a companion app that can control the fish feeder from anywhere. Feeding the fish is done using the "Feed Now" button. In addition, you can set feeding schedule and change them easily using the scheduler in the companion app and ESP32CAM is attached to this, for food tracking so that food can refilled. First started the design in Fusion 360, by taking the servo motor as the reference file. So that sketching would be very easy. The design of a file in which ESP32CAM can be slid up. But it cannot be 3D printed properly, so it is changed to a small enclosure type with a lid. For transporting food, Archimedes screw is used which is attached to the servo motor. Using ESP32CAM picture can be clicked by using Take Picture.
